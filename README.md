# Learning Basic JavaScript Variables

This README contains notes about learning basic JavaScript variables based on the Alura Node.js course. It covers:

1. **Variable Declaration**: JavaScript allows the declaration of variables using three keywords: `var`, `let`, and `const`.
   - `var`: Traditionally used for variable declaration, but scope can be confusing due to function hoisting.
   - `let`: Introduced in ES6, allows block-level scope.
   - `const`: Also block-scoped, but the variable must be assigned at the time of declaration and cannot be reassigned.

2. **Data Types**: Basic data types in JavaScript include:
   - `String`
   - `Number`
   - `Boolean`
   - `Null`
   - `Undefined`
   - `Object`

3. **Variable Scope**: Understanding the scope of variables is crucial to avoid reference errors. Scope can be divided into global scope and local scope.

4. **Best Practices**: Naming conventions and understanding when to use each variable type play a significant role in writing clear and maintainable code.
